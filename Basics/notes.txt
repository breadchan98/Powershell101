My boy JackedProgrammer for learning PowerShell----

Fundamentals:
- $psversiontable.psversion == Used to grab the version of PowerShell
- pwsh - Command line version to launch powershell 
- .ps1 file extension of PowerShell
- PowerShell has not changed from all over their versions.. all versions follow a "Verb-Noun" command, called cmdlets
- Some builds or scripts dont necessary follow the "verb-noun" command, however this is the most common and basic
- Run Selection is different from Run the whole script, in terms of format
    -- Run selection will have a different output than run whole due to following a format from the previous cmdlets
- Thousands of cmdlets exist, but knowing two cmdlets will help a lot
    1. Get-Command - typing this will load all available cmdlets
        --> if you forgot the name of a command, but remember the noun "ex; Service" run:
            ---> "Get-Command -noun "The word"
            ---> Get-Command -noun Service
            Same applies for verb, but replace with -Verb, instead of -Noun
    2. Get-Help cmdlets -full
        --> This will show the full detailed information of a cmdlet
        --> Shows if the parameters are required to be added in the command, etc.
        --> Aliases in the get-help parameters are kinda like shortcuts, if you dont feel like typing the whole commandlet
            ---> This is good for using in command lines, but not really recommended when writing scripts
            ---> Aliases can be custom made, so it's not meant for writing commandlet
- Extra Information:
    --> cd == Set-Location -Path
- "Get-ExecutionPolicy" and "Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy"
    --> This should be in "RemoteSigned" per default by Windows 11
    --> Before around Win 10 to Win 7, this was considered as restricted
    --> This will allow to run PowerShell scripts either by the creator or one that is digitally signed
    --> In the set execution part:
        ---> Unrestricted can run ANY .ps1
        ---> Restricted cant run ANY .ps1, even if digitally signed or owned by the creator
    ---> -WhatIf
        ---> Adding this will show an explanation on what happens if you run the command

        Example:
        PS C:\Users\bred-pc> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -WhatIf
        What if: Performing the operation "Set-ExecutionPolicy" on target "Unrestricted".
