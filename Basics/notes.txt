My boy JackedProgrammer for learning PowerShell----

Fundamentals:
- $psversiontable.psversion == Used to grab the version of PowerShell
- pwsh - Command line version to launch powershell 
- .ps1 file extension of PowerShell
- PowerShell has not changed from all over their versions.. all versions follow a "Verb-Noun" command, called cmdlets
- Some builds or scripts dont necessary follow the "verb-noun" command, however this is the most common and basic
- Run Selection is different from Run the whole script, in terms of format
    -- Run selection will have a different output than run whole due to following a format from the previous cmdlets
- Thousands of cmdlets exist, but knowing two cmdlets will help a lot
    1. Get-Command - typing this will load all available cmdlets
        --> if you forgot the name of a command, but remember the noun "ex; Service" run:
            ---> "Get-Command -noun "The word"
            ---> Get-Command -noun Service
            Same applies for verb, but replace with -Verb, instead of -Noun
    2. Get-Help cmdlets -full
        --> This will show the full detailed information of a cmdlet
        --> Shows if the parameters are required to be added in the command, etc.
        --> Aliases in the get-help parameters are kinda like shortcuts, if you dont feel like typing the whole commandlet
            ---> This is good for using in command lines, but not really recommended when writing scripts
            ---> Aliases can be custom made, so it's not meant for writing commandlet
- Extra Information:
    --> cd == Set-Location -Path
- "Get-ExecutionPolicy" and "Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy"
    --> This should be in "RemoteSigned" per default by Windows 11
    --> Before around Win 10 to Win 7, this was considered as restricted
    --> This will allow to run PowerShell scripts either by the creator or one that is digitally signed
    --> In the set execution part:
        ---> Unrestricted can run ANY .ps1
        ---> Restricted cant run ANY .ps1, even if digitally signed or owned by the creator
    ---> -WhatIf
        ---> Adding this will show an explanation on what happens if you run the command

        Example:
        PS C:\Users\bred-pc> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -WhatIf
        What if: Performing the operation "Set-ExecutionPolicy" on target "Unrestricted".


Variables:
- Variables act the same way in PowerShell as in other programming languages, except we declare them differently
- They are meant for storing values (basics of Programming 101 kinda meme)
- To declare variables:
    --> $variableName
    --> $variableName.methods
    Example:
        Script:
        $helloWorld = "Hello World"
        $helloWorld.GetType()

        Output:
        IsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType
        -------- -------- ----                                     --------
        True     True     String                                   System.Object 
- If a variable with no value is run, it returns null
    --> However, if you want to get an error as a reminder, add "Set-StrictMode -Version latest" at the first line of the script
- $true or $false as the value returns the boolean
    Example:
        $isBool = $true 
- Signs do not work for comparison, you must use ex:
    --> -eq is used for "=="
- Adding [data type] $variableName, this will convert based on data type (strictly speaking)
    Example:
    $myVariable = 1.2       --- This will return double (1.2)
    [int]$myVariable = 1.2  --- This will return integer (1)
- We can store cmdlets in variables and run it to get the output.

Array and ArrayLists:
