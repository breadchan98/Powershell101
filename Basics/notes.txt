My boy JackedProgrammer for learning PowerShell----

Fundamentals:
- $psversiontable.psversion == Used to grab the version of PowerShell
- pwsh - Command line version to launch powershell 
- .ps1 file extension of PowerShell
- PowerShell has not changed from all over their versions.. all versions follow a "Verb-Noun" command, called cmdlets
- Some builds or scripts dont necessary follow the "verb-noun" command, however this is the most common and basic
- Run Selection is different from Run the whole script, in terms of format
    -- Run selection will have a different output than run whole due to following a format from the previous cmdlets
- Thousands of cmdlets exist, but knowing two cmdlets will help a lot
    1. Get-Command - typing this will load all available cmdlets
        -- if you forgot the name of a command, but remember the noun "ex; Service" run:
                "Get-Command -noun "The word"
                Get-Command -noun Service
            Same applies for verb, but replace with -Verb, instead of -Noun
    2. Get-Help cmdlets -full
        -- This will show the full detailed information of a cmdlet
        -- Shows if the parameters are required to be added in the command, etc.
        -- Aliases in the get-help parameters are kinda like shortcuts, if you dont feel like typing the whole commandlet
